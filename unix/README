This is area allows you to compile a UIP project on a unix system.
This includes OSX.

At the moment this area is configured to compile with gcc-4.9

To get this working on a Yosemite systems do the following.

Find and install the GNU gcc tool chain.

For OSX the simplest way is to use brew
  see: http://brew.sh/

  Then run the normal - brew update, brew upgrade
  Then install the GNU gcc version 4.9
    brew install gcc49

  You will also need a TUNTAP interface which isn't standard on OSX (it is on Linux as I recall)
    http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/index.xhtml

You should be able to compile this area at this point
